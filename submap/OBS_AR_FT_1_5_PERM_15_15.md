## Message of Matthew

The virgin-born King, the Righteous One, comes to save Israel from their sins. When the nation rejects Him and blasphemes the Spirit, a remnant is preserved who receive His righteousness. This remnant, purified in the struck Shepherd, becomes the seed of a new ecclesia that will bear fruit among all nations until the King returns to reign.

  

**Abbreviated Message:**

Through the Shepherd-King, the remnant of Israel is equipped to take the gospel of the kingdom to all nations.
